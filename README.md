# STUDENT-ID-CARD
Student id card generation program based on concepts of Inheritance, Polymorphism and Exception Handling using real time instance. 
This code is a C++ program for managing student records. It allows users to create and display student details, including their name, PRN (10-digit unique identifier), year of study, and department. The program ensures that the PRN entered by the user is unique and validates it to be a 10-digit number. If the user enters an invalid PRN, an error message is displayed, and the program allows the user to try again.

The code uses a linked list data structure to store student records, with each record represented as an object of the "node" class. The "stud" class is derived from the "node" class and provides methods for creating and displaying student records. The "REG_ID" function generates and prints a unique registration ID for each student record.

This program can be useful for educational institutions or anyone who needs to manage a large number of student records.
